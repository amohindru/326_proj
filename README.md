This project is by team 45 titled The FoodShare project. FoodShare is a web platform that tackles food insecurity by linking individuals to local food banks, surplus food from restaurants and grocery stores, and community gardens to help combat food waste and ensure those in need can find resources efficiently. In the United States, food insecurity affects 14.3 million people which is about 11.1 percent of the total population. The application plans to utilize APIs to map out nearby food resources for those who struggle with food insecurity. It also offers a platform for businesses to donate excess food and any other resources that they might be able to provide. Overall, the platform provides users with the ability to locate and access these resources easily. Additionally, the app also includes a community forum for sharing tips, recipes, and local food events, fostering a supportive network around food sharing and sustainability. The target audience for this would be the people who struggle with food insecurity and businesses who have the means to help them.
