    <!-- About us info -->
    <p>
        In the United States, food insecurity affects 14.3 million people which is about 11.1 percent of the total population. As part of our small efforts, we present to you FoodShare. FoodShare is a web platform that tackles food insecurity by linking individuals to local food banks, surplus food from restaurants and grocery stores, and community gardens to help combat food waste and ensure those in need can find resources efficiently.
