            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>FoodShare is a web platform that tackles food insecurity by linking individuals to local food banks, surplus food from restaurants and grocery stores, and community gardens to help combat food waste and ensure those in need can find resources efficiently. In the United States, food insecurity affects 14.3 million people which is about 11.1 percent of the total population. The application plans to utilize APIs to map out nearby food resources for those who struggle with food insecurity. It also offers a platform for businesses to donate excess food and any other resources that they might be able to provide. Overall, the platform provides users with the ability to locate and access these resources easily. Additionally, the app also includes a community forum for sharing tips, recipes, and local food events, fostering a supportive network around food sharing and sustainability. The target audience for this would be the people who struggle with food insecurity and businesses who have the means to help them.</p>

        <section id="application-parts">
            <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            <p>One critical component of this application is providing users who deal with food insecurity with nearby resources that provide the locations of nearby food banks, grocery stores offering surplus food, and community gardens using an intuitive map interface. This will allow users to pinpoint the locations most relevant to them, or in other words, the ones closest to them. This can be implemented by letting the application use the user’s current location. It will also classify each location based on if it is a food bank, a grocery store, or a community garden, allowing users to quickly pick a specific location for their own needs. </p>
            <p>Another crucial feature of this application is a food sharing platform, where other users and businesses can provide updates on excess food that would be otherwise thrown away, or share tips, recipes, and information about local food-related events, fostering a supportive community network. This feature will be useful to all parties viewing this application. Businesses will be able to advertise when they have a surplus of food, and consumers will be able to provide their own insight and aid to other consumers.</p>
            <p>Another important aspect of this application comes in the form of an extension to the previous component, which is creating user profiles. Registered businesses will be able to create special profiles that allow them to access analytics of data received from their own postings, while regular users will be limited to standard postings, including alerts and notifications about food availability or upcoming events.</p>

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>One of the main data requirements of FoodShare is accessing the database of local food banks and community kitchens. This database is an integral part of our project, as it allows users to find nearby resources to help tackle food insecurities. Information such as the name, location, hours of operation, types of food, and phone number will be vital pieces drawn from the database in order to help connect users to local resources. This will aid not only those who are in need of these resources, but also those who are able to donate/volunteer but are not aware of their local centers.</p>
            <p>Another key part of our web application, FoodShare, is the data stored regarding events with surplus food. Apart from regular operations such as food banks and community kitchens, there are sometimes events which can help to tackle food insecurity within communities. Information for these types of events can be stored in the database with their name, location, hours, types of food, as well as phone number.</p>
            <p>By integrating all of this various data into a user-friendly web application, we aim to help educate local communities on how food insecurity can be treated. This will help show our commitment to tackling food insecurity as a real-world problem with accessible and useful information.</p>

            <p>Frame 1: Home Page</p>
            <p>The home page serves the purpose of introducing the user to the application, and showing them how to use it through a user-friendly interface. This will be a landing page for the application that shows users a search bar which allows them to find nearby food banks/community kitchens based on their current location, and lets them choose a range from themselves to search within. </p>
            <p>Frame 2: Results Page</p>
            <p>A results page will be redirected to after a search is conducted. This will present the user with a list of all the food banks/community kitchens within the range that they selected, with the option to click on a location for more information.</p>
            <p>Frame 3: Location Info Page</p>
            <p>When clicking on a location from the results page, the user will be redirected to a specific page for that location. This page will show information about the location, such as its name, location, hours, and the phone number.</p>
            <p>Frame 4: Application Help/Information Page</p>
            <p>This page will inform the user about the application, with its purpose and functionalities described to the user. This page can be reached by clicking on the “about” option at the top navigation bar, which is present on all pages, allowing the user to navigate throughout the application with ease.</p>

            <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
            <p>Food insecurity is a pressing global issue, increasingly prevalent in areas like Massachusetts, where an escalating homeless population reflects the harsh realities of rising living costs. FoodShare directly addresses this challenge, establishing vital connections between individuals grappling with food scarcity and an array of local resources. Through our platform, users gain access to a network of food banks, community kitchens, and events offering surplus food. Additionally, FoodShare streamlines the process for restaurants and grocery stores to contribute excess food, aligning our efforts with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals—specifically Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Our initiative is inspired by successful models like City Harvest, which demonstrates the profound impact of efficiently redistributing surplus food. City Harvest's fleet of 26 refrigerated trucks plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, daily collecting and delivering food from a diverse range of sources to feed those in need. By emulating such impactful practices, FoodShare aims not just to mitigate hunger but also to foster a more sustainable and responsible approach to food consumption and waste, addressing two critical issues simultaneously and contributing to a more food-secure future.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>The FoodShare project is an excellent illustration of how we can combine different academic disciplines to address significant issues like food insecurity. It’s about leveraging our tech expertise to develop an app that not only connects people to essential food resources but also fosters a sense of community and encourages collective problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Working on FoodShare allows us to collaborate with students from a variety of fields, bringing a rich array of ideas and perspectives to the project. This collaborative approach is vital, as it mirrors the multidisciplinary teamwork required to solve complex real-world problems. This project goes beyond academic exercise; it’s a practical application of our learning, demonstrating the real-world impact of our studies. </p>
            <p>We’re also delving into important issues, such as minimizing food waste and improving food accessibility. The project challenges us to think deeply about creating a user-friendly app that also serves a greater social purpose. It’s a powerful way to see how the concepts we learn in the classroom can be applied to effect meaningful change. By participating in FoodShare, we're not just gaining insights into our respective fields; we're learning valuable lessons in collaboration and innovation, showing how combining diverse expertise can lead to meaningful solutions.</p>
